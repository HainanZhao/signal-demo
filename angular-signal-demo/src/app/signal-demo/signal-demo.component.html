<h1>Signal Demonstration (Angular)</h1>
<p>This is a simple demonstration of how signals are implemented and triggered in Angular. The console will show the effects being run.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Correct Usage</h2>
    <div id="correct-usage">
      <p>First name: <span>{{ firstName() }}</span></p>
      <p>Last name: <span>{{ lastName() }}</span></p>
      <p>Full name: <span>{{ fullName() }}</span></p>
      <button (click)="changeName()">Change First Name</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Incorrect Usage</h2>
    <div id="incorrect-usage">
      <!-- This binds to the static `countValue` property, not the signal itself. -->
      <p>Count: <span>{{ countValue }}</span></p>
      <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
      <p class="warning">
        The count in the UI will not update because we are displaying a static variable (`countValue`)
        that was read from the signal only once during component initialization.
        The `countSignal` itself is updating, but the template isn't subscribed to it.
        Check the console to see the signal's real value.
