# Signal Demonstration Repository

This repository contains two projects demonstrating the concept of "signals" in reactive programming.

## Projects

This repository is divided into two main sub-projects:

1.  **[Simple Demo](./simple-demo/)**: A lightweight, vanilla JavaScript implementation of the signal pattern. This demo is designed to illustrate the core concepts of signals, effects, and computed values in a clear and concise way, without the overhead of a framework.

2.  **[Angular Signal Demo](./angular-signal-demo/)**: A modern Angular application that showcases how signals are implemented and used within the Angular framework. This project explores the integration of signals with Angular's change detection, component lifecycle, and the `OnPush` strategy.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive look at signals, from a foundational, first-principles implementation to their practical application in a popular front-end framework.

For more detailed information about each project, please refer to the `README.md` file within each subdirectory:

-   **[Angular Signal Demo README](./angular-signal-demo/README.md)**
